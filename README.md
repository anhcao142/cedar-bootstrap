# cedar-bootstrap
A custom bootstrap template for TOXBadge

# Goal
This repository is created to test and develop custom style for twitter bootstrap. The custom style later will be use in the cedar's main project.

# How this repo work
First you should clone the repo using `git clone`

Inside the repo folder, there is a `bootstrap` folder. This folder contains the `twitter/bootstrap` project that will be used to test the custom style. You should follow this [instruction](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap#running-documentation-locally) to host a local getbootstrap website.

The `sass/cedar` folder is where you should write your custom style. Everything later will be converted into css. Add this to the `bootstrap` project to apply the new style.
